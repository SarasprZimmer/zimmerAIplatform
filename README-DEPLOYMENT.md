# 🚀 Zimmer Platform - Direct Deployment

The codebase has been cleaned up and prepared for direct server deployment without Docker.

## ✅ What's Been Done

### Removed Docker Files
- ❌ `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- ❌ `docker-compose.local.yml` 
- ❌ `docker-compose.test.yml`
- ❌ All `Dockerfile` files
- ❌ All Docker-related configurations

### Added Direct Deployment Files
- ✅ `systemd/` - Systemd service files
- ✅ `scripts/` - Helper scripts (update, backup, health-check)
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment documentation
- ✅ `ops/` - Operations and testing scripts

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Your Server

```bash
# On your server, run:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zimmer-platform.git
cd zimmer-platform
# Follow the deployment guide in DEPLOYMENT.md
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment

Edit `/opt/zimmer/zimmer-backend/.env` with your actual values:
- Database credentials
- Secret keys
- SMTP settings
- Domain name

### 3. Update Domain Name

Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/zimmer`:
- Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain
- Configure SSL if needed

## 🔧 Benefits of Direct Deployment

- **Better Performance** - No Docker overhead
- **Easier Debugging** - Direct access to processes and logs
- **Lower Resource Usage** - More efficient memory and CPU usage
- **Simpler Management** - Standard Linux process management
- **Faster Startup** - No container initialization time

## 📊 Process Management Options

### Option 1: PM2 (Recommended)
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 status
pm2 logs
```

### Option 2: Systemd
```bash
sudo systemctl start zimmer-backend
sudo systemctl status zimmer-backend
```

## 🛠️ Helper Scripts

- `scripts/update.sh` - Update application without downtime
- `scripts/backup.sh` - Create complete backup
- `scripts/health-check.sh` - Check all services health

## 📚 Documentation

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete deployment instructions and troubleshooting guide.

## 🎉 Ready to Deploy!

Your codebase is now optimized for direct server deployment. The Docker complexity has been removed, and you have a clean, efficient deployment setup that will be much more reliable and performant.
